# Athenahub miner

The [release page](https://github.com/ATHENAHUB1/athenahub/releases/tag/v1.0.0) includes precompiled binaries for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

After extraction, there will be an executable program named "miner" included.

To start mining, you need to run "miner" and have an address to send the rewards to.

We first need to enter the directory where the "miner" is located, and then run this program in the command line.

### Windows:
```miner  --miner.etherbase <MINING_ADDRESS>```

### Linux
```./miner  --miner.etherbase <MINING_ADDRESS>```

### Mac
```./miner  --miner.etherbase <MINING_ADDRESS>```

### For example, in Windows:
```miner  --miner.etherbase 0xdB14466f952dFc16215ea3bA5d8EBaF4aC2F92ff```
